# Workout Tracker

The purpose of this application is for users to login to the application with their Google account and keep track of their exercises.  This is an exercise tracker.

## Description

This application is built with React and it allows users to signup and login using their google accounts and to add exercises.  There is no persistence in this application at this time.  The exercises stub exercises are being fed in from a JSON file using a get method from a JSON file on my github (this is done using a npm package called axious.)



The application is styled partly using bootstrap and partly with custom css.
